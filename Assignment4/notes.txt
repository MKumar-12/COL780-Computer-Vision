Mammogram detection for breast cancer
    x-rays of breast in 4kx4k dim. from Side-view(MLO) & top-view(CC) for identifying regions of malignant tissues.

    classify + localize cancerous regions within the mammograms.



Train 2 obj. detection models :
    1. Based on convolution    -> faster-RCNN, or a YOLO-based model
    2. Transformer based model -> DAB-DETR, Deformable DETR, DINO
