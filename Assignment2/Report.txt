Problem Statement:
    We are tasked with creating panoramic images from either a set of input images or a video file. 
    For image sets, the goal is to align the images and blend them seamlessly to generate a smooth output panorama. 
    In the case of video files, we need to extract frames at regular intervals, process them similarly to image sets, and create panoramas.

Approach used in Panaroma creation: 
    Input Data Handling:
        We start by handling the input data, which can be either a set of images or a video file.
        For image sets, we read all images from the specified folder and ensure they are ordered correctly.
        For video files, we extract frames at regular intervals to obtain snapshots for panorama generation.


    Cylindrical Projection:
        Before stitching the images, we project them onto a cylindrical surface to correct for perspective distortion caused by the camera lens.
        The ProjectOntoCylinder function performs this transformation, taking into account the image dimensions, focal length, and camera center.
        The transformation involves mapping each pixel in the input image to its corresponding location on the cylindrical surface, accounting for perspective effects.


    Feature Matching:
        We use the Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) algorithm to detect keypoints and compute descriptors for the features in the images.
        The keypoints and descriptors are obtained for both the base and transformed secondary images using the computeKeypointsAndDescriptors function.
        A brute-force matcher is then employed to find potential matches between the keypoints in the base image and the transformed secondary image.


    Homography Estimation:
        Using the matched keypoints, we estimate the homography matrix using the Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) algorithm.
        The findHomography function iteratively fits a homography model to the matched keypoints, rejecting outliers to improve robustness.
        The resulting homography matrix describes the transformation between the base and secondary images, accounting for perspective changes and distortions.


    Stitching:
        Finally, we warp the transformed secondary image to align with the base image using the estimated homography matrix.
        The warpPerspective function is used to apply the perspective transformation to the secondary image.
        We blend the overlapping regions of the images to create a seamless panorama, ensuring smooth transitions between them.
        Linear blending is applied to gradually blend the pixel values of the overlapping regions, resulting in a visually pleasing panorama.


    Artifact Reduction:
        Careful handling of projection artifacts and other distortions is crucial for producing high-quality panoramas.
        We address potential artifacts such as ghosting or misalignment by iteratively refining the homography estimation and adjusting the blending process.
        Proper boundary handling and correction are performed to minimize artifacts introduced during the cylindrical projection and stitching stages.



Conclusion:
    Visual inspection and user feedback indicate that using the above implementation approach, we were successfully able to stitches multiple input images into a single panoramic image.
    The resulting panoramas exhibit minimal visible seams, distortions, and artifacts, demonstrating good alignment, blending, and artifact reduction.

    Geometric accuracy, including correct perspective and scale, is maintained, ensuring the usability of the panoramas for various applications.
    Further quantitative evaluation using metrics such as root mean square error (RMSE) or peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) could provide additional insights into the panorama quality.
    In conclusion, the detailed approach outlined above offers a comprehensive and effective solution for image registration and panorama creation, achieving high-quality results suitable for diverse applications. 
    By addressing key challenges and leveraging advanced techniques, we ensure the production of visually appealing and geometrically accurate panoramas.
